# chatt-application

## Description
This chat app is a rudimentary program that I built from the geeksforgeeks website
so that I can explore the socket.io package.
The code isn't an identical copy of the original from geeksforgeeks website, I had
to refactor the code and add additional packages so that it can run without crashing.
If you're interested in exploring socket.io, please use my code and expand on your knowledge
concerning the socket.io package
